### Extend request-bound management authentication to all sensitive APIs

**What:** Apply the local management-session boundary introduced for auth snapshots and session events to every sensitive management endpoint.

**Why:** Process-global login state does not establish the identity of an individual HTTP caller, so unrelated local processes or unintended network clients may be able to act with the logged-in user's authority.

**Context:** The auth/proxy consistency work should first make session restore internal to the session-owner process and protect `/api/auth/session` plus session SSE with a request-bound local management session. Follow up by inventorying all sensitive routes, centralizing enforcement in middleware, defining loopback and LAN access policy, validating Origin/CSRF behavior, and adding unauthorized-caller integration tests. Start in `app/http/middleware/`, `app/http/routes/`, and `app/http/server.go`; reuse the session mechanism rather than creating endpoint-specific checks.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Local management-session mechanism from the auth/proxy consistency fix
